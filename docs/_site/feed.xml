In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution to address this challenging task. Based on Mask R-CNN, our proposed method implements weighted non-local (NL) blocks in the feature extractor. This integration enables an inherent denoising process at the feature level. As a result, our method eliminates the need for aligned ground truth images during training, thus supporting training on real-world low-light datasets. We introduce additional learnable weights at each layer in order to enhance the network’s adaptability to real-world noise characteristics, which affect different feature scales in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the pretrained Mask R-CNN with an Average Precision (AP) improvement of +10.0, with the introduction of weighted NL Blocks further enhancing AP by +1.0.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Joanne Lin</name></author><summary type="html">Instance segmentation for low-light imagery remains largely unexplored due to the challenges imposed by such conditions, for example shot noise due to low photon count, color distortions and reduced contrast.

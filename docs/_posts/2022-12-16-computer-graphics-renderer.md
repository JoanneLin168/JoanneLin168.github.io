This program was created as part of the Computer Graphics unit at the University of Bristol. It can render OBJ files using both rasterisation and raytracing approaches. Different lighting approaches have also been explored such as Gouraud and Phong shading. It also supports texture-mapping.

You can watch a demonstration of the Computer Graphics Renderer below!

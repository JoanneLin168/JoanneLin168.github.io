SkyWrite is a 4-man Second Year Software Engineering Project for University. The client who requested for this project is IBM.

SkyWrite will allow a sender to select an appropriate message (eg Happy Birthday, Merry Christmas etc) to a postcode. The message will appear in augmented reality 100ft above the ground. Those with the app/service will be notified that a message exists in a nearby postcode.

This is one of my most well developed project as we had to work together effectively and efficiently using GitHub and use agile development to create SkyWrite. We also used CircleCI for automated tests. It is the only project that I have currently completed that also has very in-depth documentation.

The project started in November 2021 and ended in May 2022

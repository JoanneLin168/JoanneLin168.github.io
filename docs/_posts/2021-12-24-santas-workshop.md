Santa's Workshop is a simulation showing Santa and the Elves working together to prepare for Christmas! Santa plans his route using the Nearest Neighbour Heuristic, while the elves prepare the presents simultaneously via multi-threading, and mutex locks/semaphores.

You can watch a demonstration of Santa's Workshop below!

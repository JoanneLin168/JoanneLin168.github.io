This project was one of my practice projects using PyTorch (in preparation for my undergraduate final project). Based off previous knowledge from other PyTorch tutorials, I created this classifier.

This classifier can identify the following images of the brain scans: 
- Glioma tumours
- Meningioma tumours
- Pituitary tumours
- No tumours

The dataset was downloaded from <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri>

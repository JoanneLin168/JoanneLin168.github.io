Cards Against Humanity Remake (aka CAHR) is a website created during the first Covid lockdown so my friends and I could play one of our favourite games: Cards Against Humanity. I mainly coded this myself, with the help of a friend who set up the project.

The project started in May 2020 and ended in July 2020

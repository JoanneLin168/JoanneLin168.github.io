> What online whiteboard should we use this time? The last one wasn't very great...

Thoughts that my university friends and I had as we searched the Internet for an effective yet simple online whiteboard to share ideas on, given the circumstances we were in (thanks Covid!).

**Note:** Due to the short amount of time I had on this, it still had some bugs. This project was mainly so that I gained some experience with Flask.

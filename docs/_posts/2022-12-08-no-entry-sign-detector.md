For Part 1 of my "Image Processing and Computer Vision" coursework, I had to create a no entry sign detector using image processing methods and classical Computer Vision techniques, such as colour segmentation, Sobel edge detection, Hough Transforms and Viola-Jones.

The final detector had a TPR score of 0.82 and F1 score of 0.70.

Below are some successful examples:
